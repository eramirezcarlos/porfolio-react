He is one of the best people I have brought to 3mushrooms Corp as he was highly dedicated and excellent in following commands and processes. Carlos brought fantastic results and values to 3mushrooms in the production sector of PHP web development, and I would love to work with him again. Great guy. Thank you Carlos for all of your efforts and great work..</p>

                                    <p>Carlos Ramirez worked under my direction for approximately 16 months as a Programmer/Developer on an integrated recruiting and employee management platform processing 1300 applications per month. His expertise in the LAMP Stack framework was extremely valuable in the development of a stable feature-rich system. His responsibility included building the enterprise application integration and B2B connectivity.</p>
        
                                    <p>As part of Carlosâ€™ role he communicated frequently with the operational managers and users in order to understand their IT requirements and resolve technical issues. His interaction with peers is highly commendable. Notable also is his decency and polite disposition.</p>
        
                                    <p>I recommend Carlos as a strong candidate for a similar technical position in any other organization and would readily hire him should the circumstance arise in the future..</p>
